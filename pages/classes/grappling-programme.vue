                      Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) is a grappling martial art,
                      which is basically wrestling while wearing a traditional
                      Gi (Kimono type suit). Grapplers try to overcome their
                      opponent by using a variety of holds and grips including
                      the Gi and winning by submission, making thier apponent to
                      'tap out' (give up), by applying joint locks and chokes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You will study Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) at all levels,
                      progressing through the BJJ belt system verified by ASW
                      Manchester and Gordo Jiu Jitsu Europe. Voodoo Combat is
                      also a certified member of the IBJJF and the UKBJJA. If
                      you wish to challenge yourself, we offer many
                      opportunities to compete locally, nationally and
                      internationally, often under IBJJF rules as well as
                      others.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some more about BJJ…</p>
                    <p>
                      Originating from Japan, Judo arrived on Brazilian shores
                      and was practiced with a focus on ground fighting (newaza)
                      using a range of joint locks and chokes to overcome an
                      opponent. It was developed and popularised by the Gracie
                      family, heavily influenced by the use of Submission and
                      Catch Wrestling techniques and evolved into the Brazilian
                      Jiu Jitsu we train today. Passed down and continuously
                      developed by many pioneers of the sport, and now we
                      continue to evolve it to this day at Voodoo Combat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, at Voodoo we never exclude any useful techniques
                      from other styles of grappling that use the GI such as
                      Sambo, Judo, as well as many styles of grappling that
                      don’t such as Catch Wrestling, Olympic Greco and Freestyle
                      wrestling, Collegiate Wrestling, Luta Livre, as well as
                      clinch techniques from Muay Thai.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Influenced by many schools of thought within and outside
                      Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ), we have consistently produced
                      successful competitors at all levels, including national
                      champions. Competing can help a student progress through
                      the rankings and should be viewed as an extension of a
                      student’s training but is in no way a requirement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As you progress through the BJJ belt grading system, your
                      rank will be recognised both nationally and
                      internationally. Voodoo Combat BJJ is verified and guided
                      by Kameron Atakuru of ASW Manchester and Ben Poppleton of
                      Gordo Jiu Jitsu Europe. Voodoo Combat is a member of and
                      verified by the Cobra Martial Arts Association (CMAA)
                      under whom all your belt rankings will be recognised and
                      recorded and will eventually appear on the National Black
                      Belt Register. We are also members of the UK Brazilian Jiu
                      Jitsu Association (UKBJJA) as well as being recognised by
                      the International Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Federation (IBJJF).

                      Submission and Catch Wrestling are grappling arts where
                      students wear specifically designed shorts, a
                      close-fitting top called a ‘Rash Guard’ and a gum shield.
                      You will learn to manipulate your opponent resulting in a
                      submission using various joint locks and chokes.

                    <p>Some more about Wrestling...</p>
                    <p>
                      Wrestling is a group of grappling arts (without a Gi as in
                      BJJ) and can be fought under a range of rule sets. We at
                      Voodoo train for all the predominate styles using a range
                      of joint locks and chokes to overcome an opponent. These
                      styles include Submission Wrestling, Catch Wrestling, as
                      well as Olympic Greco and Freestyle Wrestling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Although they are all individual styles of wrestling in
                      their own right, we do not differentiate or exclude any
                      skills from any grappling arts. We include techniques from
                      Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Sambo, Judo, Collegiate Wrestling,
                      Luta Livre, as well as clinch techniques from Muay Thai.
                      In fact, anything useful no matter what the source.

                    <p>
                      At Voodoo we encourage our wrestlers to compete to
                      accelerate their development and test their grappling
                      skills, but there is never any pressure to do so, the
                      choice is completely yours. We want you to enjoy your
                      journey.

                      come into the gym and practice whatever they like. You may

                      practice techniques solo that you’re developing. Most
