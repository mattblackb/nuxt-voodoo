              Our ‘Striking Programme’ consists of Thai / Kickboxing and Boxing
              (for Thai / Kick Boxing), described in more detail below. That’s a
              lot of training each week to choose from! As you can see this
              highly popular programme includes all things striking but does not
              cover the techniques in the

                      Thai Boxing and Kickboxing are striking arts involving
                      punching, kicking, elbow and knee strikes as well as
                      clinch work. We combine the very best of both these sports
                      at Voodoo so you have a comprehensive striking style. We
                      utilise a variety of safety equipment that your coach can
                      advise you upon if you require.

                      Not only does Kickboxing provide fighters with a sense of
                      confidence and vigour, it’s also a great way for gym
                      newcomers to increase stamina and transform, shedding fat
                      and developing lean muscle.

                      There are always opportunities to compete if you wish to
                      test your skills in the ultimate arena under a variety of
                      rule sets including Muay Thai classes A, B and C, K1 and
                      other Full Contact Kickboxing rulesets.

                    <p>
                      Originating from Japan, Judo arrived on Brazilian shores
                      and was practiced with a focus on ground fighting (newaza)
                      using a range of joint locks and chokes to overcome an
                      opponent. It was developed and popularised by the Gracie
                      family, heavily influenced by the use of Submission and
                      Catch Wrestling techniques and evolved into the Brazilian
                      Jiu Jitsu we train today. Passed down and continuously
                      developed by many pioneers of the sport, and now we
                      continue to evolve it to this day at Voodoo Combat.

                    <p>
                      Muay Thai, also known as Thai Boxing and K1 Kick Boxing
                      (full contact) are the ultimate arts of striking with the
                      hands, elbows, feet, legs and knees. Thai Boxing
                      specifically employs prolonged fighting within a clinch.
                      Whereas K1 Kickboxing has a much more limited clinch. They
                      are both full contact forms of striking arts and we at
                      Voodoo Combat train for both these rule sets, excluding
                      nothing of use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      There is also American style Kick Boxing, which is also
                      full contact, with no clinch work and further limits on
                      the strikes allowed. However, we don't prioritise this
                      style of training at Voodoo, although sometimes we may
                      compete within these rules.

                    <p>Some more about Boxing...</p>
                    <p>
                      Boxing is a discipline that is seemingly unaffected by
                      changing fashions in sports and remains an enormously
                      popular combat sport all around the world to this day, for
                      good reason.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Known as “the noble art”, boxing is the king of hand
                      combat sports. Training in boxing will develop a sense of
                      timing and fluid movement, learning how to successfully
                      strike an opponent and avoid incoming punches. It is the
                      ideal art to complement our Thai Kick Boxing style.
                      However, it must be modified to better suit the needs of
                      the Thai Kick Boxing arena as the rule sets would make the
                      use of standard western boxing a dangerous prospect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Boxing requires a very high level of fitness that you will
                      develop whilst simply enjoying the process of getting
                      better.
