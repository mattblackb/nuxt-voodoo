              Now you can attend the next available class on the

            </p>
            <p>
              Bring some comfortable training clothes; t-shirt and shorts
              without zips, buckles or buttons, and a drink (water is best). We
              train barefoot on the mats, but, for hygiene reasons, you’ll need
              to bring some flip-flops or sliders to wear while walking around
              the building.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you’re in the class, don’t worry about a thing, listen to
              your coach, join in and just have fun!
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't forget that you can claim your free gumshield on attending
              your first class. Ask a coach! Ninja and Samurai students don't
              need them.
            </p>

            <p>
              You don't need to rush out buying training clothes and equipment
              straight away, do your free week of training first, find out if
              you like it! Any training gear, clothing or equipment you’ll need
              in the future can be found on the ‘Classes' page.
